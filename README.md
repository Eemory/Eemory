Hi! I'm Eugene. I am a full stack web developer who recently graduated from Thinkful. Although my main passion lies in front end programming, I have the necessary skills required
for backend coding. After recently dipping my toes in React I have been focusing on projects using that framework while practicing my backend/deployment skills. I am interested in 
creating new projects that will push me creatively and skillfully as a full stack developer. You can reach me at my email listed under my profile.
